<h1>Project Overview<br><br></h1>
This project should showcase some poorly written js, which was made hastily, and then the following clean up. Afterwards idk... prob some kind of more complete version of everything showing off the finished version of the game engine made for an itch game. If the engine gets used again for a different game it'll prob get some upgrades to match that, also on an unrelated note, the engine for now won't have proper ui, just a separate file showing off what I did with it.

If ya want to see something like an integrated ui in the future you should probably comment that, btw!

<h1>Current Version<br><br></h1>
The current version is alpha 0.01, because it is so early in development I only have some basic functions and a way to draw sprites.
